The process acquiring properties and behaviour, from one class to another class is called inheritance.

We can achieve inheritance by using extends keyword

Extends keyword declares relation between two classes, once relation is declared code is reused.

Super Class / parent class

Child class / sub class / derive class

UML terminology inheritance called as "IS A" relationship
